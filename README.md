# RFM-Analysis

RFM analysis is a way to understand and categorize your customers based on their recent behavior, how often they interact with your business, and how much money they spend. Here's what each part of "RFM" stands for:

1. **Recency (R)**: This looks at how recently a customer has made a purchase or interacted with your business. Customers who have engaged with you more recently are often more valuable because they are likely to be active and interested.

2. **Frequency (F)**: This measures how often a customer interacts with your business. Customers who buy from you or engage with your services frequently tend to be more loyal and valuable.

3. **Monetary (M)**: This considers how much money a customer spends. Customers who spend more money are usually more profitable for your business.

RFM analysis helps you tailor your marketing strategies and customer management to different groups, focusing more on high-value customers to maximize your business's success.
