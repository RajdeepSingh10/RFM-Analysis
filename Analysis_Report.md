"Welcome to my RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis Project! In this endeavor, I aim to categorize and optimize customer relationships based on their recent behavior, frequency, and spending. By doing so, we can tailor the marketing strategies for improved customer engagement and business growth."

# RFM-Analysis

RFM analysis is a way to understand and categorize your customers based on their recent behavior, how often they interact with your business, and how much money they spend. Here's what each part of "RFM" stands for:

1. **Recency (R)**: This checks how recently a customer has done business with you. The more recent, the better.

2. **Frequency (F)**: This looks at how often a customer comes back to buy from you. Frequent customers are usually better.

3. **Monetary (M)**: This is about how much money a customer spends. The more they spend, the more valuable they are.

RFM analysis helps you tailor your marketing strategies and customer management to different groups, focusing more on high-value customers to maximize your business's success.
